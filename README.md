# Final-Year-Project
This folder contains the files which were used for my final year project titled "Age-friendly Voice Assistant Using Blockly". 
Some modifications were made to the original Blockly files from Google. A Bluetooth configuration is included for configuring a Raspberry Pi to utilise a speaker and USB microphone.
